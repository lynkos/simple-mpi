# Details
Each process (1) tests its share of the cases and (2) keeps a running total.
Before it finishes, it prints out (1) its ID number and (2) count of primes that it found.
The master process ends after printing (1) the total number of primes between 1 and `MAX_CONST` inclusive, and (2) the total amount of time taken to find all the primes.
