Each process:
1. Tests its share of the cases
2. Keeps a running total

Before it finishes, the process prints out:
1. Its ID number
2. Count of primes that it found

Master process ends after printing:
1. Total number of primes between 1 and `MAX_CONST` inclusive
2. Total amount of time taken to find all the primes
